title: Machine Learning Project on Imbalanced Datasets
---




## Introduction ##
Imbalanced data typically refers to a problem with classification problems where the classes are not represented equally(e.g. 90% of the data belongs to one class). They are commonly seen in  fraud detection, cancer detection, manufacturing defects, and online ads conversion. Working on an imbalanced dataset tends to be extremely tricky as simple classification algorithms tend to struggle in such situations, usually resulting in overfitting on the majority class and completely ignoring the minority class.

The dataset in this project is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/). However you will find the column names not included there - you can download the training data and the test data in the links below, courtesy of the Analytics Vidhya team:
